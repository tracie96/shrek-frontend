                            <p>I worked in the accounts department of a hotel before starting at Decagon. My experience at Decagon has been really challenging and the same time refreshing because I get to learn new problem-solving concepts and techniques everyday. 
                                It's a six months of dedication and sacrifice which will definitely be rewarding, you can do it.</p>
